Just a bunch of different stuff for unity

Includes:
- Controller for Vehicles/Characters
- RTS inspired unit selection tool
- Item/Inventory system (WIP)
- Networkingstuff for multiplayer (using mirror)
- other stuff :) 

Most of the multiplayer related stuff is based on https://github.com/DapperDino/Mirror-Multiplayer-Tutorials/tree/master/Assets
